#Â FlappySteve

This is a version of Flappy Bird in honor of Steve Jobs. Here, it is Steve Jobs in the place of the bird that has to dodge. And what dodge? Nothing more and nothing less than the typical load bars under a background of Windows errors.

Notes:
- I do not pretend that this small application is a mockery of Steve Jobs or Microsoft.
- This app was originally created by [kirualex] (https://github.com/kirualex/SprityBird).
- This app was never uploaded to the AppStore. Just the modification to learn how it works and to practice small modifications.
